<a id="what-is-getreal" class="anchor" href="#what-is-getreal" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>What is #GetReal?</h2>

<p>Creators and Developers often like to tinker and make things. For software designers, testing out a new idea is as easy as the push of a keyboard button. But for hardware and mechanical-oriented enthusiasts, experimentation is time consuming and difficult, requiring either a drawn out, repetitive fabrication process of a singular object or pain-staking effort on ensuring perfection of a first-pass construction. </p>

<p>Using the power of augmented reality, #GetReal levels the playing field. Now you can load up an stl file of a CAD, put on some Virtual Reality Goggles, and see what your CAD would look like in 3D space, all before you even had to touch a single piece of material. Users can have access to the same kind of quick testing that software engineers do, simply making some tweaks to the CAD, re-uploading, and seeing how the changes appear in the real world. #GetReal allows for rapid prototyping and efficient iterations, streamlining the process of development for aspiring mechanical and electrical engineers.</p>

<h2>
<a id="getting-started" class="anchor" href="#getting-started" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Getting Started</h2>

<p>Using #GetReal requires some extra hardware in addition to software dependencies in order to run the code. For external hardware, you will need: </p>

<ul>
<li>Google Cardboard (or some other VR headset)</li>
<li>High Performance Webcam</li>
<li>A smartphone (ios or android)</li>
<li>SplashTop Streamer (from app store)</li>
<li>A special marker that consists of four blue post-it notes arranged in a square with a black dot on one of them to preserve orientation.</li>
</ul>

<p>Once you have all your hardware, you will also need to download Python and the following python packages:</p>

<ul>
<li>Pip <code>$sudo install pip</code>
</li>
<li>OpenCV <code>$sudo pip install opencv</code>
</li>
<li>OpenGL (download from website <a href="http://pyopengl.sourceforge.net/documentation/installation.html">http://pyopengl.sourceforge.net/documentation/installation.html</a>)</li>
<li>Numpy <code>$pip install numpy</code>
</li>
<li>STL <code>$pip install numpy-stl</code>
</li>
</ul>

<a id="usage" class="anchor" href="#usage" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Usage</h2>

<p>After you have your environment configured, using #GetReal is quite easy. First, assemble your hardware, such as fixing the webcam to the Google Cardboard, setting up SplashTop, etc. Then clone the repository and load your .sti flie into the folder. Run AugmentedReality.py. The program will prompt you for an stl. Type in the name of the stl you just loaded into the folder, and put on your VR headset! From your Google Cardboard, you should see your CAD model augmented into 3D space where your post it notes are. Try walking around it and viewing it from different angles, and you should see the CAD model in its entirety, as if it was right in front of you. Have fun prototyping!</p>
