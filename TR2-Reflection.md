##Feedback and Decisions

For the first part of our review, we showed off our finished product of marker detection and vectices tracing with the expectation of getting "oo's" and "aah's". We got what we wanted, which was good feedback. In addition to our demo, we also received useful feedback on how to take the marker detection to the next step, which is figuring out how to incorporate it into the other half of the project which is 3D graphics. We learned about Numpy Stl and the basic format of the array that it returns upon reading an stl file. We plan to use that module in our project and will be researching and looking into it in the near future.

Regarding the OpenGL 3D graphics side of the project, we received very helpful advice on how to combine OpenGL and OpenCV, specifically in the realm of trying to show a 2D projection with a 3D graphic. We were having trouble with how to toggle between gluOrtho2D() and gluPerspective(). Sam showed us helper functions and aspects of OpenGL that we weren't aware of which solved our problem. 

For the virtual reality experience, we learned about different methods for showing our image from the PC to the mobile phone. Besides the virtual machine on Windows idea that we came up with, we also learned about potentially using the Raspi Neato camera's built in server side image interface and accessing our image through a browser. Another idea that came up was using Wine and accessing Windows through that. We will explore these various ideas and see which one works best, as our main criteria is trying to minimize latency between the camera input and the VR output.

Some new questions that came up among our team included how to use a Numpy stl array with our current marker detection and OpenGL programs. We are unclear as to how to ensure that the entire stl is rendered properly, especially since right now our detection is within the realms of a square with 8 vertices. A multi-sided object with irregular shapings is different from a cube, so we're wondering how to get the stl to be drawn within the boundaries of the markers. We were also wondering about how the coordinate axes of OpenGL work, as it seems that sometimes the coordinates axes are skewed and other times they are normal. OpenGL is currently disorienting for us, so we might ask Sam for this question. Another thing we were curious about is the interaction procedure for our project. We're not sure if we should make a user input interface of some sort or just manually put in a stl file into the folder and read it using the program. 

##Review Process Reflection

We believe that the review was helpful. We're kind of falling into a roadbloack, so having this review and getting some feedback was definitely an icebreaker for us. Our questions were very technical, so only certain people could answer them, but we did get the answers we wanted. Sam's ever increasing knowledge about OpenGL gave us a lot of help on how to toggle bewteen 2D and 3D in OpenGL, and Max gave us useful feedback on Numpy stl. Audrey also told us about Wine, which could potentially be of great use to us, but we will need to do research on it as well as other venues of possible options as well. We are still shaky on the OpenGL part because it's really difficult and no one on our team understands it particularly well, but with Sam on our side we'll be able to make progress.

It's possible that we might have given too little context this time because we dove right into our demos and problems without much introduction or overview of what we were doing. I did feel that our demos made up for it, as our visuals speak for themselves very easily, and our project is definitely much more easily understood with our demos. But we could've brought more people into the conversation if we gave a refresher first on what our project is.

We followed our agenda pretty closely. There was meaningful and engaging conversation going on, so we did deviate a little bit and expanded on some areas we didn't mean to go so far in depth, such as talking a lot about the virtual experience problem and less on the OpenGL problems because more people had more things to say about interactions between Linux and Windows. However, we still did well with time, and we covered everything we wanted to go over.

For improvements next time, we would definitely provide some more structure to our presentation, as this time we were really looking for answers/showing off our programs and forgot to provide context and give background information. Another thing I noticed some other teams doing that we could definitely do is ask more general questions that everyone can answer. A lot of our questions this time were really technical because we were at a roadblock and wanted answers, but next time we should definitely try to engage more of the audience with more general questions such as design, interactions, thoughts on how things look, etc. We also want to have more meaningful discussions with everyone, because when we asked about the VR experience, phrasing it in a different way such as how to access a screen in Windows with a Linux program, more people jumped in, and that conversation became more engaging and useful. The question was still technical, but maybe approaching it from a more generalized perspective would give more people the opportunity to share their thoughts while still gaining valuable feedback on the technical question.
