For software designers, testing out a new idea is as easy as the push of a keyboard button. But for hardware and mechanical-oriented enthusiasts, experimentation is time consuming and difficult, requiring either a drawn out, repetitive fabrication process of a singular object or pain-staking effort on ensuring perfection of a first-pass construction. \r\n\r\nUsing the power of augmented reality, #GetReal levels the playing field. Now you can load up an stl file of a CAD, put on some Virtual Reality Goggles, and see what your CAD would look like in 3D space, all before you even had to touch a single piece of material. Users can have access to the same kind of quick testing that software engineers do, simply making some tweaks to the CAD, re-uploading, and seeing how the changes appear in the real world. #GetReal allows for rapid prototyping and efficient iterations, streamlining the process of development for aspiring mechanical and electrical engineers.\r\n\r\n##Getting Started\r\n\r\nUsing #GetReal requires some extra hardware in addition to software dependencies in order to run the code. For external hardware, you will need: \r\n\r\n - Google Cardboard (or some other VR headset)\r\n - High Performance Webcam\r\n - A smartphone (ios or android)\r\n - SplashTop Streamer (from app store)\r\n - A special marker that consists of four blue post-it notes arranged in a square with a black dot on one of them to preserve orientation.\r\n \r\nOnce you have all your hardware, you will also need to download Python and the following python packages:\r\n \r\n - Pip `$sudo install pip`\r\n - OpenCV `$sudo pip install opencv`\r\n - OpenGL (download from website http://pyopengl.sourceforge.net/documentation/installation.html)\r\n - Numpy `$pip install numpy`\r\n - STL `$pip install numpy-stl`\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n##Usage\r\n \r\nAfter you have your environment configured, using #GetReal is quite easy. First, assemble your hardware, such as fixing the webcam to the Google Cardboard, setting up SplashTop, etc. Then clone the repository and load your .sti flie into the folder. Run AugmentedReality.py. The program will prompt you for an stl. Type in the name of the stl you just loaded into the folder, and put on your VR headset! From your Google Cardboard, you should see your CAD model augmented into 3D space where your post it notes are. Try walking around it and viewing it from different angles, and you should see the CAD model in its entirety, as if it was right in front of you. Have fun prototyping!\r\n\r\n\r\n##Acknowledgements\r\n\r\nThe team would like to thank Software Design Teachers Paul Ruvolo, Ben Hill, and Oliver Steele for their guidance and expertise. We would also like to thank the NINJAs Sophia Li, Patrick Huston, Rocco Diverdi, and Lucy Wilcox for their assistance in bugs and roadblocks along the way. Finally, a big thanks from the team to its individuals for sticking it out and accomplishing such an ambitious project in a 6 week time frame.\r\n\r\n##License\r\n\r\nMIT License\r\n\r\nCopyright (c) 2016 #GetReal\r\n\r\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy\r\nof this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal\r\nin the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights\r\nto use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell\r\ncopies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is\r\nfurnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\r\n\r\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all\r\ncopies or substantial portions of the Software.\r\n\r\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR\r\nIMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,\r\nFITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.
